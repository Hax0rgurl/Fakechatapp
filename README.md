# Fakechatapp

## Online Demo

This application can be viewed online as a live demo deployed via GitHub Pages.

**Demo URL:** [https://hax0rgurl.github.io/Fakechatapp/](https://hax0rgurl.github.io/Fakechatapp/)

### Instructions for Repository Owner to Deploy and View Demo:

1.  **Ensure Previous Setup is Complete:**
    *   The GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`) should exist.
    *   `ifaketextmessage APP/index.html` should be updated with a `<base href="...">` tag for GitHub Pages compatibility. (These changes were part of the previous "feat: Configure GitHub Pages for app demo" commit).

2.  **Commit and Push Changes:**
    *   If you haven't already, commit and push all changes (including the workflow file and `index.html` modifications) to your main branch on GitHub.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on the "Settings" tab.
    *   In the left sidebar, navigate to the "Pages" section.
    *   Under "Build and deployment", for the "Source" option, select "GitHub Actions".

4.  **Monitor Deployment:**
    *   Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
    *   A workflow named "Deploy to GitHub Pages" should start automatically after you push to main and configure Pages.
    *   Wait for the workflow to complete successfully.

5.  **Access Demo and Update README:**
    *   Once deployed, the live demo will be available at a URL similar to: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`
    *   You can find the exact URL in your repository's "Settings" > "Pages" section.
    *   **Important:** The live URL has now been updated in this README.
